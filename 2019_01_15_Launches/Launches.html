  <h1>Space - An Increasingly Private Enterprise</h1>
  <p>Non-State actors are playing an increasing role in rocket launches since the late 1980s. <br>
    Each point represents a single rocket launch and is coloured based on the type of agency performing the launch. <br>
    Launches by <span style="color:#7EBDC2">state</span> based agencies are slowly being replaced by ones conducted by
     <span style="color:#BB4430">private</span> companies and <span style="color:#FFD23F">startups</span>. <br>
    Roll-over a point to see the type of launching agency and the name of the launching mission.</p>
